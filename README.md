# Aim of the Stochastic Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to perform history matching with emulation on stochastic models, using the hmer package. Much of the calibration process is the same for stochastic and deterministic models, and we therefore recommend that before starting this workshop you complete [Workshop 1](https://danny-sc.github.io/determ_workshop/index.html), which shows how to perform history matching with emulation on deterministic models.
